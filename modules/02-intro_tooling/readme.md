This section is less tehcnical and more about RE methodology and the tools used to work through these sort of problems. Don't expect to be an expert in these tools, just be able to fumble your way around with the help of writeups. The only thing that will make you comfortable with these tools is putting a ton of time behind the wheel with them. 

1. Watch this quick video from  [LiveOverflow on tools for RE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NTXFUxcKPc) on tools and very basic RE. Don't worry too much about what is happening, I'm just trying to provide vague context for things the next time you see them. 
2. Then do this [GDB tutorial](gdb-gef/readme.md) from Nightmare.
3. Work through [Aviv's Intro to GDB](gdb-unit_02.md)
4. Next, install Ghidra, an open source decompiler [using this tutorial](ghidra/readme.md).
5. Finally, get pwntools, a truly magical tool for CTF adventuring, [using this guide](pwntools/readme.md).

Alright! You have the tools you need to make things happen!
