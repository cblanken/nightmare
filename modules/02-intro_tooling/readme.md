1. Start by reading through the [RPISec MBE Lecture 02](02_lecture.pdf) and [RPISec MBE Lecture 03](03_lecture.pdf) on tools and very basic RE. Don't worry too much about what is happening, I'm just trying to provide vague context you can go back to reference when you need it. 
2. Then do this [GDB tutorial](gdb-gef/readme.md).
3. Next, install Ghidra, an open source decompiler [using this tutorial](ghidra/readme.md).
4. Finally, get pwntools, a truly magical tool for CTF adventuring, [using this guide](pwntools/readme.md).
5. Watch this quick video from  [LiveOverflow on tools for RE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NTXFUxcKPc). 
6. 
Alright! You have the tools you need to make things happen!
