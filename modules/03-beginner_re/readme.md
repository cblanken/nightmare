Enough talking, let's start doing some RE! 

The magic of Nightmare is that we care about getting reps and sets in, and that is what you are about to do. Follow these writeups exactly and build that muscle memory.


0. Watch [this video from LiveOverflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VroEiMOJPm8) to give you an idea of what goes into RE. 

1. First, we are going to start with a fun CTF challenge that will take us on a whirlwind tour of x86: [Challenge 1](csaw18_x86tour_pt1/)

2. Many RE challenges fall into the category of CrackMe's. I love this tutorial from Nora Codes. [Crack Me Collection](https://github.com/NoraCodes/crackmescrackmes/). Work through them and you will know what is needed to solve 50% of CrackMes you find in most competitions. When you get bored, move on, or stop at the 4th challenge. Can't have you spending too much time in one place. 

As a note, NoraCodes uses Radare for the examples, you should be using Ghidra. There is no major functional difference between the way the two work, but you should use Ghidra. (I should do Ghidra writeups of everything but... haven't had the time yet.)

3. How about another CTF challenge? [Challenge 2](pico18_strings/)

4. Helithumper! [Challenge 3](helithumper_re/)

5. Do you beleaf in life after love? [Challenge 4](csaw19_beleaf/)

This is a good array of challenges and you should have some decent understanding of what these types of challenges look like.
